Description of Project
We're building a tool that dynamically constructs real-time service dependency maps using OpenTelemetry telemetry data (not just maps from trace data but maps of whole end to end business services including containers, VMs, CICD actions etc.)— without relying on traditional service discovery or static configuration. The system ingests component metadata and dependency relationships directly from emitted telemetry, enabling precise modeling of how services and components relate in any environment. On top of this live topology, we overlay alerts (starting with integrations like Alertmanager) directly onto the graph, showing severity, volume, and propagation paths in real context. This gives SRE and operations teams a powerful visual interface that connects infrastructure and application alerts to the services they affect — something current alerting UIs (like Grafana, PagerDuty, or Datadog) often lack, as they tend to separate alerting from the actual service topology. Our focus is on making alerts meaningful and actionable in context, improving incident response and understanding of systemic risk.
